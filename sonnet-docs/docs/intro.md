# Claude CLI Study Project

Welcome to the Claude CLI Study Project documentation! 

This project is focused on studying and learning from Claude CLI's architecture, design patterns, and capabilities. We analyze how Claude CLI efficiently processes large codebases and create experimental implementations to test our understanding.

## Project Overview

Our study of Claude CLI focuses on several key aspects:

### 1. Understanding Claude CLI's Architecture

We're studying how Claude CLI's architecture enables efficient code understanding:

- **Semantic Chunking**: How Claude CLI divides codebases into meaningful segments
- **Hybrid Processing**: How it balances local tools with remote API calls
- **Session Management**: How context is maintained across interactions
- **Differential Updates**: How changes are efficiently processed

### 2. Experimental Implementation

Based on our findings, we're creating experimental implementations:

- **CLI Emulator**: A prototype that emulates Claude CLI's core functionality
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Extending our learnings to other LLM providers via LiteLLM
- **Research Tools**: Utilities for studying and analyzing Claude CLI's behavior

## Research Goals

- Understand the architectural decisions behind Claude CLI
- Learn from Claude CLI's efficient code processing techniques
- Document observed patterns and behaviors
- Create educational resources for others studying LLM CLI tools
- Explore how similar patterns can be applied to other LLM providers

## Getting Started

- [Research Methodology](/docs/methodology)
- [Experimental Setup](/docs/experiments)
- [Claude CLI Analysis](/docs/findings/claude-cli-analysis)
- [Experimental Implementations](/docs/experiments/implementations)

## Key Learning Areas

For those interested in specific aspects of our study:

- [Semantic Chunking Analysis](/docs/findings/semantic-chunking)
- [Hybrid Architecture Study](/docs/findings/hybrid-architecture)
- [LiteLLM Integration Experiment](/docs/guides/litellm-integration)

This is an educational project focused on learning from Claude CLI. Our goal is not to replicate its functionality exactly, but to understand and learn from its design principles and architectural patterns.

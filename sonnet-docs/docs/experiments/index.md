# Experimental Studies

This section documents our experimental studies of Claude CLI. Each experiment is designed to investigate specific aspects of Claude CLI's architecture and behavior.

## Experiment Categories

### Semantic Chunking Studies

These experiments investigate how Claude CLI processes large codebases:

- **[Chunking Behavior Analysis](chunking/behavior-analysis)**: Studies how Claude CLI divides codebases into semantic chunks
- **[File Selection Patterns](chunking/file-selection)**: Examines how Claude CLI determines which files are relevant
- **[Context Preservation](chunking/context-preservation)**: Analyzes how context is maintained across chunks

### Differential Update Studies

These experiments analyze how Claude CLI handles codebase changes:

- **[Change Detection Mechanisms](differential/change-detection)**: Studies how changes are identified
- **[Update Efficiency Analysis](differential/efficiency)**: Measures token usage in update scenarios
- **[Context Integration](differential/context-integration)**: Examines how changes are integrated into existing context

### Session Management Studies

These experiments explore how Claude CLI maintains session state:

- **[Session Persistence](sessions/persistence)**: Analyzes how context is maintained between interactions
- **[Context Window Management](sessions/context-window)**: Studies how Claude CLI manages token limits
- **[Extended Thinking Triggers](sessions/extended-thinking)**: Identifies when extended thinking mode is activated

### Hybrid Architecture Studies

These experiments investigate how Claude CLI balances local and remote processing:

- **[Local Processing Identification](hybrid/local-processing)**: Determines which operations happen locally
- **[Tool Implementation Analysis](hybrid/tools)**: Studies how Claude CLI's tools work
- **[Remote API Optimization](hybrid/api-optimization)**: Examines how API calls are optimized

## Running Experiments

Our experimental code is available in the [experiments](https://github.com/your-github-username/sonnet-3.7-docs/tree/main/experiments) directory of our repository. Each experiment includes:

1. A detailed README explaining the experiment's purpose and methodology
2. Python scripts for running the experiment
3. Analysis notebooks for examining the results

To run experiments yourself, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/sonnet-3.7-docs.git
cd sonnet-3.7-docs

# Install dependencies
pip install -r experiments/requirements.txt

# Run a specific experiment
python experiments/chunking/analyze_chunking.py --repo=/path/to/test/repo --query="Explain the auth system"

# Generate analysis report
python experiments/chunking/generate_report.py --results=results/chunking_analysis_*.json
```

## Experimental Implementations

Based on our experimental findings, we've developed several experimental implementations:

- **[Claude CLI Emulator](implementations/cli-emulator)**: A prototype that emulates Claude CLI's core functionality
- **[Multi-Provider CLI](implementations/multi-provider)**: Extension to support multiple LLM providers
- **[Semantic Chunker](implementations/semantic-chunker)**: Implementation of semantic chunking based on our findings

These implementations are educational in nature and designed to test our understanding of Claude CLI's architectural patterns.

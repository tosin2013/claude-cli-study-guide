# Hybrid Architecture Study

Our research into Claude CLI reveals a sophisticated hybrid architecture that balances local processing with remote API calls. This page documents our findings on how this architecture works and its implications.

## Overview

Claude CLI appears to employ a hybrid architecture that:

1. Processes some operations locally on the user's machine
2. Sends other operations to Claude's API for processing
3. Intelligently balances between these approaches for optimal performance

This hybrid approach allows Claude CLI to be both responsive and powerful, with minimal latency for common operations while leveraging the full capabilities of Claude for complex reasoning.

## Local Processing Components

Based on our experiments, Claude CLI appears to handle these operations locally:

### 1. File System Operations

File operations show characteristics of local processing:

- **File Reading**: File contents are accessed without API latency
- **Directory Traversal**: Directory structure can be explored rapidly
- **Search Operations**: Basic searches appear to happen locally
- **File Modification**: File writes happen with minimal latency

### 2. Context Management

Context appears to be managed locally:

- **Context Caching**: Previously processed code is cached locally
- **Context Preparation**: Context is prepared before API calls
- **Context Updates**: Context is updated incrementally with changes

### 3. Tool Management

Claude CLI's tool integration shows signs of local processing:

- **Tool Selection**: Tools are selected based on local logic
- **Tool Execution**: Many tools appear to run locally
- **Tool Output Processing**: Tool outputs are processed before API calls

## Remote Processing Components

These components appear to be handled by remote API calls:

### 1. Code Understanding

Complex understanding tasks are handled remotely:

- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding code meaning and purpose
- **Relationship Mapping**: Identifying relationships between components
- **Intent Recognition**: Understanding user intent from queries

### 2. Code Generation

Code generation shows characteristics of remote API processing:

- **Implementation Logic**: Creating implementation logic
- **Algorithm Design**: Designing complex algorithms
- **Pattern Application**: Applying design patterns

### 3. Reasoning About Code

Complex reasoning tasks appear to be remote:

- **Debugging Logic**: Finding bugs in complex code
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyzing performance issues
- **Security Review**: Identifying security concerns

## Interface Between Local and Remote

The local-remote interface shows these characteristics:

- **Query Preparation**: Queries are prepared locally before API calls
- **Context Selection**: Relevant context is selected locally
- **Response Processing**: API responses are processed locally
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Local processing falls back to API when needed

## Performance Characteristics

The hybrid architecture demonstrates these performance characteristics:

### 1. Latency Management

- **Low Latency Operations**: File navigation, basic search, simple edits
- **Medium Latency Operations**: Code analysis, simple generation
- **High Latency Operations**: Complex reasoning, large refactors

### 2. Token Efficiency

- **Context Optimization**: Only relevant context is sent to the API
- **Incremental Updates**: Only changes are processed, not entire codebase
- **Response Reuse**: Common responses may be cached locally

### 3. Reliability Features

- **Offline Capabilities**: Some features appear to work with limited connectivity
- **Partial Progress**: Work can continue even if some API calls fail
- **State Preservation**: Session state is preserved across API calls

## Experimental Evidence

Our experiments to identify the hybrid architecture included:

### Network Analysis

We monitored network traffic during Claude CLI usage and found:

- Not all file operations generated API calls
- API calls contained optimized context, not raw file contents
- Some operations completed faster than network latency would allow

### Performance Testing

We tested operations with varying network conditions and found:

- Some operations were unaffected by network latency
- Other operations were directly affected by API response time
- Complex operations scaled with model complexity, not local resources

### Feature Analysis

We analyzed feature behavior and found:

- Some features continued working with limited connectivity
- Error patterns differed between local and remote operations
- Response characteristics varied between local and remote features

## Practical Applications

Our findings on the hybrid architecture have several practical applications:

1. **Optimal Tool Design**: Design tools that balance local and remote processing
2. **Query Optimization**: Structure queries to minimize API calls
3. **Context Preparation**: Prepare and organize code for efficient API processing
4. **Offline Workflow**: Understand which operations can work offline

## Experimental Implementation

Based on our findings, we've created an experimental implementation that attempts to replicate Claude CLI's hybrid architecture. See our [CLI Emulator Implementation](/docs/experiments/implementations/cli-emulator) for details.

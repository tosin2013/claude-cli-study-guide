# Research Findings

This section documents our findings from studying Claude CLI's architecture and behavior. Our research has uncovered several key insights into how Claude CLI processes large codebases, manages context, and optimizes token usage.

## Semantic Chunking

Our analysis of how Claude CLI processes large codebases revealed a sophisticated semantic chunking system:

- **Contextual Prioritization**: Claude CLI seems to prioritize code based on relevance to the query
- **Structure Preservation**: Semantic units like functions and classes are kept intact
- **Import Recognition**: Important contextual elements like imports are always included
- **Whitespace Optimization**: Whitespace and comments appear to be optimized away in many cases

We've documented detailed findings about semantic chunking in the following sections:

- [Chunking Strategies](semantic-chunking)
- [File Selection Patterns](file-selection)
- [Context Preservation](context-preservation)

## Hybrid Architecture

Claude CLI employs a hybrid architecture that balances local processing with remote API calls:

- **Local Tool Processing**: Many file operations appear to happen locally rather than in the API
- **Context Management**: Session state is maintained locally but synchronized with the API
- **Differential Updates**: Changes to files are processed efficiently without full reingest

Our detailed findings on the hybrid architecture include:

- [Local Processing Analysis](hybrid-architecture/local-processing)
- [Tool Implementation](hybrid-architecture/tools)
- [API Optimization](hybrid-architecture/api-optimization)

## Session Management

Claude CLI demonstrates sophisticated session management capabilities:

- **Persistent Context**: Session context is maintained across multiple interactions
- **Incremental Updates**: Context can be updated incrementally without full reprocessing
- **Thinking Mode Selection**: Claude CLI seems to adaptively choose between standard and extended thinking modes

Our session management findings include:

- [Session Persistence](session-management/persistence)
- [Context Window Management](session-management/context-window)
- [Extended Thinking Mode](session-management/extended-thinking)

## Token Efficiency

Claude CLI shows impressive token efficiency:

- **Token Reduction**: Overall token usage is significantly lower than what raw file sizes would suggest
- **Contextual Loading**: Only relevant portions of files are loaded into context
- **Deduplication**: Common code patterns appear to be deduplicated or referenced

## Experimental Data

All our findings are backed by experimental data available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-github-username/sonnet-3.7-docs/tree/main/experiments/results).

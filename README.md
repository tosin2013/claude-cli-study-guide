# Claude CLI Study Guide

[![GitHub Pages Status](https://github.com/your-github-username/claude-cli-study-guide/workflows/github-pages/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-github-username/claude-cli-study-guide/actions)

This project focuses on studying and learning from Claude CLI's architecture, design patterns, and capabilities. We analyze how Claude CLI efficiently processes large codebases and create experimental implementations to test our understanding.

## 🔍 Learning Focus Areas

- **🧠 Semantic Chunking Analysis**: Studying how Claude CLI divides codebases into meaningful segments
- **📊 Differential Update Patterns**: Investigating how Claude CLI tracks and processes changes
- **🔄 Hybrid Architecture Study**: Understanding how Claude CLI balances local and remote processing
- **💾 Session Management Research**: Learning how Claude CLI maintains context across interactions
- **⚙️ LiteLLM Integration Experiment**: Extending Claude CLI patterns to other LLM providers
- **🧪 Experimental CLI Emulator**: Testing our understanding by building an experimental implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started with Our Study

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git 2.23+
- An Anthropic API key with access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Claude CLI installed (for comparative analysis)

### Setup for Learning and Experimentation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/claude-cli-study-guide.git
cd claude-cli-study-guide

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your Anthropic API key

# Run the setup script
npm run setup
```

### Running Experiments

```bash
# Study how Claude CLI processes a directory
npm run experiment:chunking -- /path/to/test/repo

# Analyze differential update behavior
npm run experiment:diff -- /path/to/repo

# Test our experimental CLI emulator
npm run demo:emulator
```

## 🧪 Experimental Implementations

Our project includes several experimental implementations based on our study of Claude CLI:

### Semantic Chunking Study

```python
# Run our semantic chunking analysis on a codebase
python scripts/experiments/analyze_chunking.py --repo=/path/to/repo --query="Explain the auth system"
```

### Multi-Provider CLI Emulator

Our experimental CLI emulator extends Claude CLI patterns to other LLM providers:

```python
from claude_study.emulator import ClaudeCliEmulator

# Create emulator with any LiteLLM-supported model
emulator = ClaudeCliEmulator("anthropic/claude-3-sonnet")

# Add code context and get responses (similar to Claude CLI)
emulator.file_send("main.py")
response = emulator.prompt("Explain what this code does")
```

## 📋 Research Roadmap

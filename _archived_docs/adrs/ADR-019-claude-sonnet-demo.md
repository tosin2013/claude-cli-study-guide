# ADR-019: Claude 3.7 Sonnet Demo Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Claude 3.7 Sonnet represents a significant advancement in understanding large codebases. The original Medium blog post provides theoretical insights, but we need a practical, hands-on demonstration that users can follow to implement these concepts themselves.

We need to create a comprehensive demonstration that shows how to:
1. Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet's capabilities for code understanding
2. Implement semantic chunking for large codebases
3. Process and analyze code using Claude's API
4. Apply best practices for code navigation and comprehension

## Decision
We will create an interactive demo focused on Claude 3.7 Sonnet's capabilities for code understanding. The demo will:

1. **Provide practical code examples**:
   - Working implementations of semantic chunking algorithms
   - Claude API interaction code examples
   - Complete end-to-end workflow demonstrations

2. **Include a step-by-step tutorial**:
   - Setup instructions for API access
   - Guidelines for preparing codebases for analysis
   - Examples of effective prompting for code understanding
   - Troubleshooting common issues

3. **Showcase real-world applications**:
   - Code exploration of a sample open-source project
   - Pattern recognition in complex codebases
   - Automatic documentation generation
   - Debugging assistance

4. **Include interactive elements**:
   - Live code examples using React components
   - Visualizations of code chunking results
   - Comparative analysis of different chunking strategies

## Implementation Approach

### Core Demo Components

1. **Semantic Chunking Implementation**:
   ```python
   def semantic_chunk(codebase_path, language_ext_map=None):
       """
       Process a codebase using semantic chunking.
       
       Args:
           codebase_path: Path to the codebase directory
           language_ext_map: Mapping of file extensions to language parsers
           
       Returns:
           List of semantic chunks with metadata
       """
       # Implementation details...
   ```

2. **Claude API Interaction**:
   ```python
   def analyze_code_with_claude(chunks, prompt_template, api_key):
       """
       Send code chunks to Claude 3.7 Sonnet for analysis.
       
       Args:
           chunks: Processed code chunks
           prompt_template: Template for prompting Claude
           api_key: Anthropic API key
           
       Returns:
           Analysis results from Claude
       """
       # Implementation details...
   ```

3. **Interactive Web Demo**:
   - Upload code samples for analysis
   - Select chunking strategies
   - View chunking visualizations
   - See Claude's analysis results

### Tutorial Structure

   - Optimization strategies

4. **Working with Claude's API**
   - Making API requests
   - Crafting effective prompts
   - Handling and processing responses

5. **Analyzing a Real Codebase**
   - Step-by-step walkthrough with an open-source project
   - Pattern identification
   - Architecture analysis

6. **Advanced Techniques**
   - Multi-file context management
   - Long-running sessions
   - Caching strategies
   - Cost optimization

## Consequences

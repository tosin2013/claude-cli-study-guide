# ADR-003: Studying Claude CLI's Hybrid Local/Remote Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Claude CLI effectively combines local processing with Claude's remote capabilities. After studying the Claude CLI, we've observed that it implements a hybrid approach that:

1. Processes file reading, glob matching, and pattern recognition locally
2. Only sends necessary code context to Claude's API
3. Uses intelligent tools to filter and process code before sending to Claude
4. Determines when to use standard or extended thinking modes based on task complexity

This hybrid approach is consistent with Anthropic's research indicating that combining local tools with AI capabilities is more cost-effective and often produces better results than relying solely on AI.

## Decision
We will study and replicate Claude CLI's hybrid architecture to understand:

1. How Claude CLI's tools (View, GrepTool, GlobTool, etc.) filter and process content locally
2. How Claude CLI determines what code context to send to the API
3. How session state is maintained between interactions
4. When and how extended thinking mode is activated
5. How Claude CLI handles large codebases through intelligent chunking

Our experimental implementation will:
1. Create local equivalents of Claude CLI's core tools
2. Implement a session management system similar to Claude CLI
3. Develop a routing mechanism that mimics Claude CLI's decision-making process
4. Study and implement similar chunking mechanisms for large codebases

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Deeper understanding of Claude CLI's architecture and design decisions
- **Positive**: Learning how Claude CLI balances local processing vs. remote API calls
- **Positive**: Insight into efficient token usage strategies employed by Claude CLI
- **Positive**: Practical experience implementing a similar architecture
- **Negative**: Experimental implementation may not match Claude CLI's exact behavior
- **Negative**: Some internal mechanisms of Claude CLI may not be fully observable

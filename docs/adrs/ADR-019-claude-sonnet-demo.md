# ADR-019: Claude CLI Learning Demo Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our project is focused on studying and learning from Claude CLI's architecture and capabilities. To consolidate and share our findings effectively, we need to create a practical, hands-on demonstration that showcases what we've learned about Claude CLI and how it efficiently processes large codebases.

## Decision
We will create an interactive learning demo focused on Claude CLI's capabilities, architecture, and our experimental findings. The demo will:

1. **Document Claude CLI's observed architecture**:
   - Show the hybrid local/remote processing model
   - Illustrate the semantic chunking mechanisms we've observed
   - Explain the session management patterns
   - Demonstrate the differential update approach

2. **Include practical examples**:
   - Side-by-side comparisons of Claude CLI commands and our findings
   - Examples of how Claude CLI processes files and directories
   - Demonstrations of effective prompting techniques
   - Visualizations of how Claude CLI handles session context

3. **Showcase our experimental implementations**:
   - Our Claude CLI emulation experiments
   - Implementations of observed chunking strategies
   - Session management approaches based on our study
   - Multi-model adaptation using LiteLLM

4. **Include interactive learning elements**:
   - Visualization of code chunking behavior
   - Comparison of different processing approaches
   - Interactive CLI command execution examples
   - Token usage analysis visualizations

## Implementation Approach

### Core Demo Components

1. **Claude CLI Study Findings**:
   ```markdown
   ## How Claude CLI Processes Codebases
   
   Based on our experiments, Claude CLI appears to process codebases using a sophisticated 
   three-stage approach:
   
   1. **Local Analysis**: Files are processed locally using tools like grep and glob
   2. **Semantic Chunking**: Large files are intelligently divided into semantically 
      meaningful units
   3. **Contextual Prioritization**: Only relevant code context is sent to the API
   
   Our experiments revealed interesting patterns in how files are selected and processed...
   ```

2. **Experimental CLI Emulator Demo**:
   ```python
   # Example of our CLI emulator built from our study
   def demonstrate_cli_emulation():
       """
       Demonstrate our experimental CLI emulator based on Claude CLI study.
       """
       # Initialize our experimental emulator
       emulator = ClaudeCliEmulator(model_name="anthropic/claude-3-sonnet")
       
       # Create a session similar to how Claude CLI does it
       session = emulator.session_create(name="demo-session")
       
       # Process a directory using our learned chunking approach
       result = emulator.dir_send("./sample_codebase", file_pattern="*.py")
       
       # Show how we handle prompts based on our study of Claude CLI
       response = emulator.prompt("Explain the main components of this codebase")
       
       return {
           "session_handling": session,
           "directory_processing": result,
           "prompt_response": response
       }
   ```

3. **Interactive Learning Components**:
   - Interactive visualization of Claude CLI's estimated architecture
   - Comparison of Claude CLI behavior with our experimental implementation
   - Token usage analysis for different approaches

# ADR-006: CI/CD Integration Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To maintain an up-to-date AI understanding of the codebase, changes need to be automatically processed and presented to the AI after successful builds.

## Decision
We will implement a CI/CD integration architecture that:
1. Adds a dedicated step in CI/CD pipelines to update Claude after successful builds
2. Generates summary files of changes for Claude to process
3. Groups changes by module to maintain logical organization
4. Creates dedicated Claude sessions for significant updates
5. Provides feedback on successful AI updates through CI/CD reports
6. Uses extended thinking mode for major architectural changes

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Ensures Claude's understanding stays current with the codebase
- **Positive**: Automates what would otherwise be a manual process
- **Positive**: Creates a standardized format for AI updates
- **Negative**: Adds complexity and potential failure points to CI/CD pipelines
- **Negative**: Increases CI/CD build times

## Implementation Details
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/main.yml  
jobs:  
  build:
    # ... existing build steps  

  update-claude:
    needs: build  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3  
        with:  
          fetch-depth: 5  
      - name: Generate Claude Updates  
        run: node update-claude.js  
      - name: Update Claude with Changes  
        run: |  
          claude-code session create --name "Project-Update-$(date +%Y%m%d)"  
          for file in ./claude-updates/*; do  
            claude-code file send "$file"  
          done  
          claude-code prompt "Please analyze these recent changes and update your understanding of the codebase accordingly."

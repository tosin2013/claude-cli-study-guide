# ADR-017: Claude CLI Emulation with LiteLLM Integration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Claude CLI is designed specifically for Anthropic's Claude models and provides an excellent interface for code understanding and analysis. As part of our learning and experimentation process, we want to:

1. Study how Claude CLI works and what makes it effective
2. Experiment with extending its capabilities to other LLM providers
3. Understand how Claude CLI's features could be adapted for other models
4. Learn from Claude CLI's design while building an experimental emulator

Several options exist for implementing a Claude CLI emulator with multi-model support:
- Implement separate clients for each model provider
- Use an abstraction layer like LangChain
- Use LiteLLM as a routing layer
- Create our own abstraction layer

## Decision
We will study Claude CLI's architecture and create an experimental emulator using LiteLLM as our interface for accessing multiple LLM providers. LiteLLM provides a consistent interface to over 100 different LLM providers while maintaining OpenAI-compatible response formats.

Key aspects of this experiment:

1. **Study Claude CLI**: We'll analyze Claude CLI's behaviors, features, and interfaces
2. **CLI Emulation**: We'll develop an experimental CLI emulator that replicates Claude CLI's functionality
3. **Cross-Model Adaptation**: We'll explore how Claude CLI's features can be adapted to other models
4. **Learning Implementation**: We'll document our findings and learning throughout the process

Our experimental implementation will have three main components:
- A Claude CLI analyzer for studying the original CLI's behavior
- An experimental CLI emulator based on our findings
- A multi-model adaptation layer using LiteLLM

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
1. **Deep Learning**: Gain insights into Claude CLI's architecture and design decisions
2. **Practical Experience**: Hands-on experience implementing similar capabilities
3. **Expanded Understanding**: Learn how Claude CLI features translate to other models
4. **Documentation**: Create valuable learning resources for others studying Claude CLI

### Negative Consequences
1. **Implementation Challenges**: Accurately emulating Claude CLI is complex
2. **Model Limitations**: Many models lack capabilities comparable to Claude
3. **Experimental Nature**: Our implementation will be experimental, not production-ready
4. **Rapid Evolution**: Claude CLI itself evolves quickly, challenging our understanding

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Claude CLI Study Phase

First, we'll analyze Claude CLI's behavior:

```python
# Example of studying Claude CLI sessions
import subprocess
import json

def study_claude_session_behavior():
    """Study how Claude CLI creates and manages sessions."""
    # Create a Claude session
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["claude", "session", "create", "--name", "study-session"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    session_data = json.loads(result.stdout)
    
    # Analyze session properties
    session_id = session_data.get("id")
    
    # Study how file contents are processed
    file_result = subprocess.run(
        ["claude", "file", "send", "--session", session_id, "test_file.py"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    
    # Study prompt behavior
    prompt_result = subprocess.run(
        ["claude", "prompt", "--session", session_id, "Explain this code"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    
    return {
        "session_behavior": session_data,
        "file_behavior": json.loads(file_result.stdout),
        "prompt_behavior": json.loads(prompt_result.stdout)
    }
```

### 2. Experimental CLI Emulator

We'll create an experimental emulator based on our findings:

```python
class ClaudeCliEmulator:
    """Experimental emulator for Claude CLI based on our study."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name, config=None):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.config = config or {}
        self.current_session = None
        self.context_window = self._get_context_window()
        
    def _get_context_window(self):
        """Get the context window size for the selected model."""
        # Based on our study of Claude CLI's model handling
        model_context_windows = {
            "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet": 128000,
            "anthropic/claude-3-opus": 200000,
            "gpt-4-turbo": 128000,
            "mistral/mistral-large": 32000,
        }
        return model_context_windows.get(self.model_name, 16000)
    
    def session_create(self, name=None):
        """Emulate Claude CLI's session creation based on our study."""
        import time
        self.current_session = name or f"session-{int(time.time())}"
        # Implementation based on observed Claude CLI behavior
        return {"session_id": self.current_session, "status": "created"}
    
    def file_send(self, file_path):
        """Emulate Claude CLI's file sending capability based on our study."""
        # Study showed that Claude CLI reads files locally and processes them
        # before sending to the API
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        # Process content according to our observations of Claude CLI
        # Studying showed that Claude CLI intelligently chunks large files
        processed_content = self._process_content_like_claude_cli(content)
        
        return {"status": "file_processed", "file": file_path}
```

### 3. LiteLLM Multi-Model Adaptation

We'll explore how to adapt Claude CLI features to other models:

```python
from litellm import completion

def adapt_claude_features_to_model(model, messages, claude_features):
    """Adapt Claude-specific features to other models based on our study."""
    # Study showed that Claude CLI uses these features in specific ways
    thinking_mode = claude_features.get("thinking_mode")
    system_prompt = claude_features.get("system_prompt")
    
    # Adapt based on model capabilities we've studied
    adapted_params = {}
    
    if thinking_mode == "extended" and model.startswith("anthropic/"):
        # Only Claude models support this natively
        adapted_params["temperature"] = 0.2
    elif thinking_mode == "extended":
        # For non-Claude models, approximate extended thinking
        # Based on our study of how extended thinking works
        adapted_params["temperature"] = 0.2
        adapted_params["top_p"] = 0.95
        
        # Modify system prompt to encourage more thorough thinking
        if system_prompt:
            system_prompt += "\nTake your time to think through this thoroughly."
    
    # Construct the call based on our findings
    if system_prompt:
        messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + messages
    
    response = completion(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        **adapted_params
    )
    
    return response
```

## Learning Goals and Documentation

Throughout this experiment, we'll document:

1. **Claude CLI Patterns**: Design patterns and architectural choices
2. **Feature Translation**: How Claude-specific features map to other models
3. **Implementation Challenges**: Difficulties encountered and solutions found
4. **Performance Comparisons**: How our emulator compares to the original Claude CLI

## Initial Learning Tasks

1. Study Claude CLI commands and their behaviors
2. Analyze how Claude CLI processes files and directories
3. Investigate Claude CLI's session management
4. Experiment with replicating core features
5. Document findings and create learning resources

## Experiment Conclusion

This ADR represents an experiment in learning from Claude CLI's design and architecture. Our goal is educational - to understand what makes Claude CLI effective and how those lessons might be applied more broadly.

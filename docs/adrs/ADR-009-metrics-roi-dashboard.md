# ADR-009: Metrics and ROI Dashboard

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To justify and optimize the use of AI in the development process, teams need visibility into costs, time savings, and overall return on investment.

## Decision
We will implement a metrics and ROI dashboard that:
1. Tracks token usage and associated costs
2. Measures time saved on common development tasks
3. Calculates ROI based on developer time saved vs. AI costs
4. Provides visualization of usage patterns and optimization opportunities
5. Generates reports for management review
6. Compares performance across different Claude models and thinking modes

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Provides transparency into AI usage and costs
- **Positive**: Helps identify opportunities for further optimization
- **Positive**: Supports decision-making about AI investment
- **Negative**: Requires collecting and analyzing usage data
- **Negative**: May create pressure to optimize for cost over developer experience

## Implementation Details
```javascript
// metrics-dashboard.js
const dashboard = {
  trackUsage: (session, tokens, mode) => {
    // Record token usage, cost, and thinking mode
    db.sessions.insert({
      id: session.id,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      inputTokens: tokens.input,
      outputTokens: tokens.output,
      thinkingTokens: tokens.thinking,
      cost: calculateCost(tokens),
      mode: mode
    });
  },
  
  calculateROI: (timeframe) => {
    // Calculate cost savings based on developer time saved
    const costs = db.sessions.sum('cost', { timeframe });
    const timeSaved = db.tasks.sum('timeSaved', { timeframe });
    const developerHourlyCost = config.developerHourlyCost;
    
    return (timeSaved * developerHourlyCost) - costs;
  }
};
```

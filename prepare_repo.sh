# Application Summary

## Architecture
This document provides a summary of the application's architecture, key modules, and their relationships.

## Key Modules
- Placeholder for module descriptions.
- Include information about the functionality, dependencies, and interaction with other modules.

## Relationships
- Describe how the modules interact with one another.
- Mention any patterns such as MVC, Microservices, etc.

## High-Level Next Steps for LLM
1. Identify and generate module summaries for frontend, backend, and database.
2. Document core workflows and user journeys within the application.

# Generate module summaries with placeholders for customization
echo "Generating module summaries... Please customize the contents as necessary."
cat <<EOL > "$MODULE_SUMMARY_DIR/frontend_summary.txt"
# Frontend Module Summary
- **Purpose**: Describe the frontend's role in the application.
- **Key Components**: List key components such as main frameworks, libraries, and UI components.
- **Dependencies**: Mention any dependencies on backend services or external APIs.
EOL

cat <<EOL > "$MODULE_SUMMARY_DIR/backend_summary.txt"
# Backend Module Summary
- **Purpose**: Describe the backend's role in the application.
- **Key Components**: List key components such as main frameworks, APIs, and data handling.
- **Dependencies**: Mention any database connections and external services it relies on.
EOL

cat <<EOL > "$MODULE_SUMMARY_DIR/database_summary.txt"
# Database Module Summary
- **Purpose**: Describe the database’s role in the application.
- **Key Components**: List database types, schema designs, and any ORM tools used.
- **Dependencies**: Mention the relationships with the backend and data sources.

# Core Workflows

## User Journeys
1. **Product Browsing**:
   - Relevant code files: [list of files responsible for navigation, product listing]
  
2. **Checkout Process**:
   - Relevant code files: [list of files responsible for cart management, payment handling]
  
3. **User Authentication**:
   - Relevant code files: [list of files responsible for login, logout, user session management]

### Note:
- The workflows and summaries provided are examples. Please modify them to fit the specific use case and structure of your application repository.
